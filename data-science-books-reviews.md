# Data Science Books Reviews

Here I will post some short reviews of the books I have read and own about data science. If you are reading this, some background: I am a researcher trained in dentistry and radiology, not mathematics. So I started reading and learning about statistics with all the knowledge gaps, but mostly with an opportunistic focus: now I have a problem, how should I solve it? So my comments on the books are mostly about how well they give me tools to solve my problems with data. For a (mostly) list of all my books, check [here](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/sergiouribe)
